# vqa

In this project, I will build a visual question answering application using both computer vision and NLP. 

The firs step is always EDA 

I will start by feature extraction for both, using relative models. Then I will combine the features and see the results.

## Initial plan: 
Extending the project timeline to 8 weeks will allow more time for exploring different VQA model architectures. Here's an updated project plan:

### Week 1: Project Setup and Dataset Preparation
1. Research and Understand VQA
2. Data Collection and Preprocessing
3. Environment Setup
4. Initial Data Exploration

### Week 2-3: Model Exploration and Development (English Questions)
1. Research Different VQA Model Architectures (e.g., VQA-Attention, Stacked Attention Networks, etc.)
2. Implement and Train Multiple VQA Models with Various Architectures
3. Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Evaluation
4. Select the Best Performing VQA Model

### Week 4: Web Interface Development
1. Design and Develop a Dummy Web Interface for Visual Question Answering
2. Integrate the Selected VQA Model with the Web Interface
3. Test the Web Interface Functionality

### Week 5-6: Multilingual Extension (Arabic Questions)
1. Data Augmentation with Arabic Translations
2. Modify the Selected VQA Model to Support Multilingual Questions
3. Train and Evaluate the Multilingual VQA Model
4. Optimize the Multilingual Model for Performance

### Week 7: Further Model Exploration
1. Explore Advanced VQA Architectures such as Bottom-Up and Top-Down Attention, MCAN, LXMERT, etc.
2. Implement and Train Additional VQA Models with New Architectures
3. Compare Performance Metrics of Different Models

### Week 8: Finalize AI Models and Deployment
1. Select the Best Performing VQA Model from Additional Architectures Explored
2. Fine-tune the Chosen Model for Improved Performance
3. Document Model Architectures, Training Details, and Performance Metrics
4. Deploy the Trained VQA Model and Web Interface on a Server
5. Final Testing and Demonstration

This extended plan allows for a more thorough exploration of different VQA model architectures, enabling you to select the most suitable model for your project. Make sure to document your findings and decisions along the way to facilitate future iterations and improvements. Good luck with your extended VQA project!
